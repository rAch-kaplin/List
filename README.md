# Doubly Linked List Implementation

This project implements a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** in C.
A doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each node contains:
- A **value** (data).
- A pointer to the **next** node.
- A pointer to the **previous** node.

This allows traversal in both **forward** and **backward** directions.

## **Features**
- **Insertion** at the beginning, end, or a specific position.
- **Deletion** of a node by value.
- **Search** for a node in the list.
- **Detect a loop in the list** to prevent infinite traversals.
- **Reverse the list** by swapping the `next` and `prev` pointers.

## **Build and Run**
To compile and execute the program, use the provided `Makefile`.

### **Build**
```
make
```
### **Run**
```
./do
```
